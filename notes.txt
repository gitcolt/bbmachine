transaction isolation level?
"Some databases use a default transaction isolation level that isn’t suitable for polling tables for changes.

In MySQL the default transaction isolation level is REPEATABLE-READ: meaning the transaction won’t see changes made by other transactions until the current transaction is committed.

Changing that to the READ-COMMITTED isolation level is recommended."
